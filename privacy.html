							<h3>Who we are</h3>
							<p>Sam's Leaf Guide is a not-for-profit guide made by Sam Holford, based in Auckland, New Zealand. The website is http://samholford.github.io/leafguide/</p>
							<h3>Principles regarding privacy</h3>
							<p>I respect your privacy, and won’t do anything with your personal information that I wouldn’t be happy being done with mine.</p>
							<p>Personal information may flow through certain third parties, always via an encrypted connection, such as the website host and email platform.</p>
							<p>I will not:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Share your data with third parties not described in this document</li>
							<li>Sell, rent, or lease your data</li>
							<li>Use your data for political purposes or analysis</li>
							<li>Perform algorithm-based analytics on your data</li>
							<li>Track your activity across the world wide web</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Overall, I have made efforts to collect as little personal information as possible.</p>
							<h3>Data collected</h3>
							<p>I collect no data myself and do not access data collected by third parties.</p>
							<p>Third parties GitHub, Disqus, and YouTube collect information from your browser and cookies.</p>
							<h3>How I use your data</h3>
							<p>I do not collect any personal data via this website intentionally, and therefore do not use it.</p>
							<h3>How long I retain your data</h3>
							<p>I do not collect any personal data via this website intentionally, and therefore make no assurances that any data would be retained for any length of time.</p>
							<h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
							<p>You have the right to:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Access your personal data</li>
							<li>Correct errors in your personal data</li>
							<li>Request the erasure, anonymisation, or pseudoanonymisation of your personal data</li>
							<li>Object to the processing of your personal data</li>
							<li>Receive an export of your personal data</li>
							</ul>
							<p>My ability to comply with these rights may be limited by:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Legal requirements to maintain records</li>
							<li>Storage of personal information within backups that are not directly modifiable</li>
							<li>My ability to identify personal data as being related to you</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I will always do everything within my ability to uphold your rights and requests regarding your personal data.</p>
							<h3>How I protect your data</h3>
							<p>Information passed between the website and your device is encrypted. No personal information is stored on this website.</p>
							<h3>What data breach procedures I have in place</h3>
							<p>In the event of a material data breach, I will post a notice on the website within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. I do not record contact details, so cannot contact you directly. I will take necessary steps to prevent further breaches.</p>
							<h3>Sharing of your data</h3>
							<p>I will not share your personal information with anyone other than core data processors required for operating the website. These data processors are:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>GitHub – hosting provider</li>
							<li>Disqus – comment system</li>
							<li>YouTube – host of embedded videos</li>
							<li>Gmail – if you email me</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I trust these data processors with your (limited) personal information and while I take responsibility for data use, I actually have no control over what these third parties do.</p>
							<p>I will generally resist the sharing of your personal information with law enforcement, but only while operating within the law. In other words, I will share your personal information with appropriate parties if compelled by law.</p>
							<h3>Cookies</h3>
							<p>I do not use cookies for this website.</p>
							<p>The embedded YouTube videos use cookies.</p>
							<p>I do not believe that I need to annoy you with a cookie banner, per the exemptions listed within the&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm#section_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU cookie legislation</a>.</p>
							<h3>Final remarks</h3>
							<p>This privacy policy may change without notice. Rest assured my principles of respecting your privacy are unlikely to change.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions about this policy, have suggestions for policy changes, or would like to exercise your rights over your personal information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:samholford@gmail.com">samholford@gmail.com</a>.</p>
